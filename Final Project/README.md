# Recommendation Engine For Online Programming Platform

<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications. The aim of competitive programming is to write source code of computer programs which are able to solve given problems. Major companies hire from top coding platforms. The planning, workforce, time and money which goes into recruiting is cut to half by the competitive coding platforms.


<h4>GOALS</h4>
1. To build a model that can predict the number of attempts required by user to solve a problem based on problem complexity and the user’s profile as to the number of problems solved, total number of submissions completed, user contribution to the online platform, location of the user, rating of the user and the rank of the user.
2. Recommending the questions that a programmer should solve given his/her current expertise is a big challenge for Online Programming Platforms but is an essential task to judge a programmer’s expertise in that particular area which will help companies in their hiring process.
